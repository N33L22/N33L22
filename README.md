## 👋 Hello, I'm Neel Kapadia!

### 🚀 AI Enthusiast | 🧠 Data Science Explorer | 💻 Open-Source Contributor

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm currently pursuing my final year of B.Tech in AI and Data Science, where I focus on developing innovative AI/ML solutions to address complex real-world challenges. My work spans various domains, integrating cutting-edge technologies and robust methodologies to advance the field of artificial intelligence.

### 🔍 What I'm Working On
- **Detecting Frauds in Financial Transactions using AI/ML**: Building a sophisticated fraud detection system with Python 🐍, leveraging autoencoders for feature extraction and Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks (R-CNN) for sequential analysis. This system analyzes transaction patterns to detect anomalies in real-time, enhancing financial security.
- **Blockchain-based Student Certification Verification**: Developing a decentralized platform utilizing blockchain technology 🔗 for secure and tamper-proof verification of academic records. This solution ensures that student certifications are authentic and verifiable.

### 📈 Recent Work
- **PDF Query Assistant**: An intelligent tool that lets users upload PDFs and extract information directly from the content using advanced NLP techniques 🤔. This assistant enhances the ease of information retrieval and contextual understanding.
- **Prediction Analysis with Preprocessing**: A comprehensive pipeline that converts heterogeneous file formats (Word, PDF, HTML, XML, and website links) into Excel 🗂️. This facilitates accurate predictions and insightful visualizations through structured data conversion and preprocessing.

### 🌱 Currently Learning
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Exploring deeper into text analysis, sentiment detection, and language modeling to develop more sophisticated and context-aware applications 📚.
- **AI/ML in Geodata Exploration**: Applying machine learning algorithms to geospatial data to refine mineral exploration techniques and improve prediction accuracy 🌍.

### 💡 Fun Fact
